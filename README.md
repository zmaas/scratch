# Scratch Projects

This repository is the scratch workspace that I use to work on
implementing different ideas and simple code that doesn't require a
repository of its own. I try to keep the folders named in a
straightforward manner, and all code is MIT Licensed.

## TODO

[] Add better documentation for each subfolder.
[] Discuss a Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace
[] Contribute to GNU Code, File GNU CLA.
