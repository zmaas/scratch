With the advent of tools like knitr, sweave, and Rmarkdown, it has become increasingly easy to generate attractive documents in a literate-programming style. For example, this document was generated using R markdown, and composed in emacs using ESS.

# Necessary imports

To make this document work, we use the following imports:

```{R, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tufte)
library(ggthemes)
```

# Sample data generation

We demonstrate inline data analysis as follows, using the nycflights13 data set. 

```{R, message=FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
by_dest <- group_by(flights, dest)
delay <- summarise(by_dest, count = n(), dist = mean(distance,
 na.rm = TRUE),
 delay = mean(arr_delay,
 na.rm = TRUE))
delay <- filter(delay, count > 20, dest != "HNL")
```

With this analysis done, we can create a figure.

```{R, fig.margin=TRUE, results="hide"}
ggplot(data = delay, mapping = aes(x = dist, y = delay)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = count), alpha = 1/3) + theme_tufte() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

So easy! We also have support for inline LaTeX code. Equations can either be inline ($a^2 + b^2 + 2ab = c^2$), or on their own lines:

$$
\zeta (s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty = \frac{1}{n^s}
$$

The possibilities are truly... limitless.
